## react-native-redux-demo

This project is created in order to understand the working of redux.
It is in react-native language.
There are 4 functions available in it which can be seen in the images along with the initial look of the application.
The data is shown in alert boxes.

<pre>1. Initial Look</pre>
<pre>2. Add Employee</pre>
<pre>3. Employee Left </pre>
<pre>4. Get Current state(react-redux's Store.get() method which tells the data stored in state.)</pre>
<pre>5. Get Employee data by id (which is called with react-redux's mapStateToProps method  )</pre>
